				<h3>Introduction-</h3>
				
				<h4>UI & UX designer and developer, based in The Hague</h4>

				<p style="padding-right: 3em; color: #000000; font-size: 17px;">My name is Wendy de Lange, 25 years old and currently living in The Hague. I was brought up trilingual, which means that I manage Dutch as well as English and Spanish. To learn Spanish I went to Colombia for one year to follow classes there to be able to learn the language and culture. It was a fun adventure and I would do it again if it is possible. At the moment I am in my final year of the Bachelor of Communication & Multimedia Design in The Hague. I have taken this course with pleasure and I can't wait to start working for a company. </p>

				<p style="padding-right: 3em; color: #000000; font-size: 17px;">In addition to the course I am busy with reading, writing, music and drawing. I like to do this in peace and quiet. For this I often look for a park on or near the beach to be more in nature and get inspiration. </p>
