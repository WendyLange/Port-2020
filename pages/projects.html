				<p>PayDirect is a system where you can order and pay directly through the use of your phone. By working with the application, you don't need to wait for the waiter to assist you. With one click the bill has been processed and the tip is given if you selected it. </p>

				<h5 id="kook">Kookclub</h5>
				<p>Nowadays our society is digitizing at a fast pace, many people cannot keep up, especially the elderly. This can be because they don't possess the skills, or have diminishing skills due to illnesses/diseases, or because they can't afford the motivation anymore. As a result, this group becomes excluded from everyday social life. This can lead to loneliness, financial problems and more.
				In order to solve this problem, we first conducted research into the target group to see how we can solve this. The solution that has been devised is intended to motivate them intrinsically to improve their digital skills so that they can deal with their requests for facilities via the Internet.â€¯ "How can seniors aged 55 and over with limited digital skills be motivated to improve their digital skills so that they can participate in the digital world?".</p>

				<p>This is also what the Cooking Club was created for. With the cooking club, users learn not only how to make dishes, but also how to handle a digital object. This makes the transition to a digital environment a lot smaller and therefore easier to understand for the elderly. In the app, a function has been created so that all text can be changed into speech for the visually impaired. In addition, it has been made simple so that it doesn't look complicated.</p>

				<h5 id="porty">Visual design </h5>
				<p>Visual design & front-end development was an assignment in which you were going to build a website together with 3 others to show your qualities. This was about making creative parts that have to do with design and creative development.</p>
				<p>While building the website I worked on building the website with all the technical parts. It was about making the code and entering all the necessary parts to make it a whole. The website has also been made responsive, so that it is easy to see on any digital screen. If you want to see the result, below is the link to the website.</p>
